# MogCorp-LMU-Tools-Bundle
MogCorp has been proudly and consistently underperforming since around breakfast time.\
\
While great efforts are consistently made to maintain this low standard of productivity and development, 
many of our staff have succumbed to a recent outbreak of optimism resulting in an upsurge of instances of adequacy.\
\
In an attempt to reinstate our long and proud history of mediocrity fuelled by existential dread, chronic ennui, and creeping entropy, we are seeking donations from those in the 'real world'
who may find some of our products of use.\
\
Please consider donating so this project can continue to fail sideways.\
